# medical_interactive_viz: A Medical Visualization Library (Python/Altair)
A library of common visualisations useful for medical applications
Author: Juan Delgado, PhD

## Overview
**This repo is WIP**

This Python library, built on top of Altair, provides a set of reusable functionsfor creating common visualizations in clinical trials.  It aims to streamline the process of generating informative and publication-ready graphics, allowing researchers to focus on data analysis rather than spending excessive time on plotting.

## Features

* **Based on Altair:** Leverages Altair's declarative syntax for creating interactive and web-friendly visualizations.
* **Reusable Functions:** Offers pre-defined functions for generating specific plot types commonly used in clinical trials and medical reporting
* **Customizable Templates:** Provides customizable templates that adhere to common clinical trial reporting standards.
* **Data Integration:** Designed to work with Pandas DataFrames, the standard data structure in Python for data analysis.
* **Interactive Exploration:** Supports interactive features such as zooming, panning, and tooltips, enabling users to explore their data in detail.
* **Examples:** Includes examples to help users quickly create visualizations.

## Installation

``` bash
    # install requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt
